## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://danielrbaran.github.io/marketing-refactor/)

Accessibility is rapidly evolving from the standpoint of user expectations, as well as site status and performance.  No longer a nice-to-have, it's important for a site experience to keep up with code innovations that make site UX increasingly friendly to all users.  Our team has brought this site's code up to modern standards, and will continue to ensure it remains current.

## Code Refactor Example

Installation has dependencies on:
library.foo
vendors.bar

This is to support certain custom high-resolution elements.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
    <title>Horiseon Marketing</title>
</head>
```
The above code is an example of one of the only specific changes the weary author managed to notice and implement while battling with git.



## Usage 

It's recommended that teams utilize the audible tool tips feature to highlight salient metadata.  Note that it was built specifically to allow updaets without requiring a full code deployment.

## Learning Points 

The team noted certain disparities in the way different regional authorities and agencies either support or require accessibility features.  The does not seem to be full consensus on overall standards currently.
